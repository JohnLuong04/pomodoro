# Pomodoro
The pomodoro technique is a studying technique where work sessions are split up
into four 25 minute intervals separated by a five-minute break in between each
interval (Each interval is known as a pomodoro). Upon completion of four
consecutive pomodoros, there is a longer break typically lasting 15-30 minutes.

This project is a simple pomodoro timer to keep track of pomodoros and breaks.
